# KAM - A web-based Windows Camera Preview App

This app is built with vanilla JavaScript and uses the WebComponents API to create custom elements. It is a simple camera app that allows you to take pictures.

## Roadmap

This is a list of features that I would like to add to this app. The order of the list is not necessarily the order in which I will implement them.

- [ ] Add a video recording feature
- [ ] Settings page
  - [ ] Mirror camera
  - [ ] Change default directory
- [ ] Filters
